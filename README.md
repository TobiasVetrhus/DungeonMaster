## Project
### Title
Dungeon Master

### Description
This is a console application that lets the user create a Hero. The user can give the Hero a specific class
(Wizard, Archer, Swashbuckler, or Barbarian), and from then on level up their hero, equip weapons and armor, or
display their hero's summary.

The application is made in .NET 6 using C#.

### Installation

Clone this Git Repository to try the application:

`https://github.com/TobiasVetrhus/DungeonMaster.git`

### Usage

Run the application in Visual Studio 2022. 

### Methodology
The application was developed using an iterative/incremental development approach. I initialized the project with simple sketches
to get an overview of the classes, their necessary properties and methods, as well as their relationships.

When I started developing i implemented the classes incrementally; starting from the top-level interface, classes and enums, and 
moving down to the more detailed lower-level classes. While implementing each class, I refined and adjusted the project as my understanding
of the system requirements and structure evolved. This allowed me to make improvements as I progressed.

### Testing
I've made unit tests for the most prominent parts of the functionality like character- weapon-, and armor creation, 
calculations, exceptions, etc. according to requirements to ensure that its intended functionality works. Moreover, I've
also tested using `Console.Writeline();` statements during development.
